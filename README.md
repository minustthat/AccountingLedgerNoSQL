Similar concept to the accounting ledger application, except this one functions a bit more like a traditional bank.
We document whether a transaction is a deposit or a purchase, document your balance, 
and store more information about the user. There will soon be a feature that further categorizes purchases
i.e(home, entertainment, medical bills, etc).
